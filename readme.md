Name: My Virtual Pet

Description: Virtual Pet is a Javascript pet that should be less naughty and distracting than a real life one!
Virtual Pet allows your pet to have a name and get older. You can feed your pet and take them on walks. When they get older, they get more hungry and less fit! You can counteract this by taking them on walks! Your pet can tell you when they need food or exercise. it also tells you if your pet is alive. 

Installation: Fork this repository and clone down your fork.

Change into the cloned folder.

Run npm install to install the necessary libraries required for Node.js to run.

Roadmap: add a front end to virtual pet
